# Profile API Enhancement Specification

## Purpose
Enhance the existing profile API to support comprehensive user information retrieval and updates, including integration with rewards system and dedicated profile database management.

## Requirements

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Dedicated Profile Database
System SHALL use a dedicated SQLite database for user profile data.

#### Scenario: Database Separation
- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** the system SHALL automatically create the profiles database if it doesn't exist
- **AND** the system SHALL ensure all profile-related tables are properly configured
- **AND** the system SHALL establish separate connection pools for profile data
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain transaction isolation between profile and main databases

### Requirement: Rewards System Integration
System SHALL integrate with rewards system to include points balance in profile data.

#### Scenario: Points Balance Integration
- **WHEN** a user requests their profile
- **THEN** the system SHALL fetch their current points balance from the rewards service
- **AND** the system SHALL include this information in the profile response
- **AND** the system SHALL cache the result for subsequent requests within the cache window
- **AND** the system SHALL handle service unavailability gracefully with default values

### Requirement: Multi-Database Architecture
System SHALL support multiple database connections for different data domains.

#### Scenario: Multi-Database Operations
- **WHEN** performing operations that span multiple data domains
- **THEN** the system SHALL establish connections to both main and profile databases as needed
- **AND** the system SHALL route queries to appropriate databases based on data type
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain separate transaction scopes for each database
- **AND** the system SHALL ensure data consistency across database boundaries

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Enhanced Profile API Response
System SHALL return comprehensive user information in profile API responses.

#### Scenario: Complete Profile Response
- **WHEN** a user calls GET /user/profile
- **THEN** they SHALL receive all their profile information in a single comprehensive response
- **INCLUDING** personal details, preferences, statistics, and business data
- **AND** the response SHALL be properly structured with all fields populated
- **AND** the response SHALL provide a complete view of their user profile and activity

### Requirement: Profile Update API Enhancement
System SHALL support updating new profile fields in the profile update API.

#### Scenario: Extended Profile Update
- **WHEN** a user wants to update their profile information
- **AND** they provide any combination of profile fields
- **THEN** the system SHALL update only the provided fields
- **AND** the system SHALL preserve existing data for fields not provided in the request
- **AND** the system SHALL validate all input data according to field-specific rules
- **AND** the system SHALL return the complete updated profile with all current data

### Requirement: Profile API Performance
System SHALL maintain high performance for profile API endpoints with enhanced functionality.

#### Scenario: High-Performance Profile Operations
- **WHEN** users frequently access their profile or update preferences
- **THEN** the system SHALL respond quickly with cached data where appropriate
- **AND** the system SHALL minimize database load through intelligent caching strategies
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain data consistency between cached and live data
- **AND** the system SHALL provide performance metrics for monitoring and optimization
