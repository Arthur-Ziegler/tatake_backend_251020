# Enhance User Profile Functionality

## Summary

Enhance the existing user profile functionality by adding missing fields, creating a dedicated profile database, and improving the API to support user preferences, statistics, and business-related data integration.

## Background

The current user profile system has basic functionality but needs enhancement to support:
- Additional user profile fields (gender, birthday, theme, language, notification settings)
- Dedicated SQLite database for profile data
- Integration with rewards system for points balance
- Improved API responses with comprehensive user information

## Current State Analysis

- ✅ Basic user profile API exists (`GET /user/profile`, `PUT /user/profile`)
- ✅ SQLAlchemy models are in place (User, UserSettings, UserStats)
- ✅ JWT authentication is integrated
- ❌ Missing some requested fields in the database model
- ❌ No dedicated profile database (uses main tatake.db)
- ❌ No integration with rewards system for points balance

## Why

Current user profile functionality is incomplete and doesn't meet the full requirements for user management. The existing implementation lacks:
- Essential profile fields like gender and birthday
- Dedicated database storage for profile data
- Integration with the rewards system for points balance
- Comprehensive user preferences and settings
- Proper data organization for scalability

This enhancement will provide a complete user profile system that supports all required user data, better data organization, and improved user experience.

## Proposed Changes

1. **Enhance Database Models**: Add missing fields (gender, birthday, notification settings)
2. **Create Dedicated Profile Database**: Separate SQLite database for user profiles
3. **Improve API Responses**: Include points balance and comprehensive user statistics
4. **Enhance User Settings**: Add theme, language, and notification preferences
5. **Add Statistics Integration**: Connect with rewards system for real-time data

## Success Criteria

- User profile API returns all requested fields including points balance
- Dedicated profile database is created and properly connected
- All existing functionality continues to work
- Performance is maintained with database separation
- API documentation is updated

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Changes are additive and don't break existing functionality
- **Medium Risk**: Database migration may need careful planning
- **Low Risk**: API changes are backward compatible

## Implementation Approach

1. Create new database models for enhanced profile fields
2. Set up dedicated profile database connection
3. Enhance API responses to include additional data
4. Update existing profile endpoints
5. Add comprehensive testing
6. Update API documentation

## Dependencies

- Existing user authentication system
- Rewards system for points integration
- Database migration utilities
- SQLAlchemy ORM setup
