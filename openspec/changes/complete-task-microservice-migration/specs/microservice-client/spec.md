# Enhanced Task Microservice Client Specification

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Enhanced Path Mapping
The system SHALL provide intelligent path mapping to bridge the gap between existing API paths and microservice RESTful paths.

#### Scenario: Query tasks path transformation
- **GIVEN** a client calls `POST /tasks/query` with user_id in request body
- **WHEN** the microservice client processes the request
- **THEN** it SHALL transform to `GET /api/v1/tasks/{user_id}` and call the microservice
- **AND** the user_id SHALL be extracted from request body and validated as UUID

#### Scenario: Single task operations path transformation
- **GIVEN** a client calls `PUT /tasks/{task_id}` or `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}`
- **WHEN** the microservice client processes the request
- **THEN** it SHALL transform to `PUT /api/v1/tasks/{user_id}/{task_id}` or `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/{user_id}/{task_id}`
- **AND** both user_id and task_id SHALL be validated as UUID format
- **AND** the user_id SHALL be extracted from JWT token

#### Scenario: Top3 query path transformation
- **GIVEN** a client calls `POST /tasks/top3/query` with date in request body
- **WHEN** the microservice client processes the request
- **THEN** it SHALL transform to `GET /api/v1/tasks/top3/{user_id}/{date}`
- **AND** the date SHALL be extracted from request body and validated

### Requirement: UUID Format Validation
The system SHALL enforce strict UUID format validation for all user_id and task_id parameters before calling microservice.

#### Scenario: Valid UUID format validation
- **GIVEN** a user_id or task_id in valid UUID format (e.g., "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000")
- **WHEN** the UUID validator processes the ID
- **THEN** it SHALL pass validation and allow the request to proceed

#### Scenario: Invalid UUID format rejection
- **GIVEN** a user_id or task_id in invalid format (e.g., "test-user-123")
- **WHEN** the UUID validator processes the ID
- **THEN** it SHALL raise a ValueError with descriptive error message
- **AND** the API SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request

#### Scenario: Empty UUID validation
- **GIVEN** an empty or null user_id or task_id
- **WHEN** the UUID validator processes the ID
- **THEN** it SHALL raise a ValueError indicating the field cannot be empty

### Requirement: Direct Response Passthrough
The system SHALL directly return microservice responses without format transformation since the microservice already provides the expected format.

#### Scenario: Successful API response handling
- **GIVEN** a microservice returns response in format `{"code": 200, "success": true, "message": "success", "data": {...}}`
- **WHEN** the client receives the response
- **THEN** it SHALL directly return the response without any transformation
- **AND** the response format SHALL match the expected client format

#### Scenario: Error response handling
- **GIVEN** a microservice returns error response in format `{"code": 404, "success": false, "message": "Task not found", "data": null}`
- **WHEN** the client receives the error response
- **THEN** it SHALL directly return the error response without transformation
- **AND** the error code and message SHALL be preserved

### Requirement: Enhanced Error Handling
The system SHALL provide comprehensive error handling for network issues, timeouts, and microservice unavailability.

#### Scenario: Microservice connection failure
- **GIVEN** the microservice is not responding or connection fails
- **WHEN** the client attempts to make a request
- **THEN** it SHALL return HTTP 503 Service Unavailable
- **AND** the error message SHALL indicate "Task微服务连接失败，请稍后重试"
- **AND** the error SHALL be marked as recoverable

#### Scenario: Microservice timeout
- **GIVEN** the microservice takes longer than the configured timeout (30 seconds)
- **WHEN** the request times out
- **THEN** it SHALL return HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout
- **AND** the error message SHALL indicate "Task微服务响应超时，请稍后重试"
- **AND** the error SHALL be marked as recoverable

#### Scenario: Microservice HTTP errors
- **GIVEN** the microservice returns HTTP 4xx or 5xx status codes
- **WHEN** the client receives the error response
- **THEN** it SHALL directly pass through the error response
- **AND** the original status code and error message SHALL be preserved

### Requirement: Request Data Adaptation
The system SHALL adapt request data format to match microservice expectations while maintaining client compatibility.

#### Scenario: Task creation request adaptation
- **GIVEN** a client sends POST /tasks with priority "medium" (lowercase)
- **WHEN** the client processes the request for microservice
- **THEN** it SHALL convert priority to "Medium" (titlecase) as expected by microservice
- **AND** it SHALL add user_id to request body if not already present

#### Scenario: Date format adaptation
- **GIVEN** a client sends date in ISO format with timezone
- **WHEN** the client processes the request
- **THEN** it SHALL ensure the date format matches microservice expectations
- **AND** it SHALL handle timezone conversion if necessary

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Connection Pool Management
The system SHALL implement efficient connection pooling to optimize performance and resource usage.

#### Scenario: Connection reuse
- **GIVEN** multiple API requests are made in sequence
- **WHEN** the client processes these requests
- **THEN** it SHALL reuse HTTP connections from the connection pool
- **AND** the connection pool SHALL support up to 20 keepalive connections

#### Scenario: Connection lifecycle management
- **GIVEN** the application is shutting down
- **WHEN** shutdown is initiated
- **THEN** the client SHALL gracefully close all connections in the pool
- **AND** it SHALL wait for in-flight requests to complete

### Requirement: Request Retry Mechanism
The system SHALL implement intelligent retry logic for recoverable network errors.

#### Scenario: Transient network error retry
- **GIVEN** a recoverable network error occurs (connection timeout, temporary DNS failure)
- **WHEN** the client encounters such an error
- **THEN** it SHALL automatically retry the request up to 3 times
- **AND** it SHALL use exponential backoff between retries (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **AND** it SHALL only retry for recoverable errors

#### Scenario: Non-retryable error handling
- **GIVEN** a non-retryable error occurs (4xx status codes, authentication failures)
- **WHEN** the client encounters such an error
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT retry the request
- **AND** it SHALL immediately return the error to the caller

### Requirement: Request Tracing and Logging
The system SHALL provide comprehensive request tracing and logging for debugging and monitoring.

#### Scenario: Request logging
- **GIVEN** any API request is made to the microservice
- **WHEN** the request is processed
- **THEN** it SHALL log the request method, URL, and key parameters
- **AND** it SHALL log the response status code and response time
- **AND** sensitive data (passwords, tokens) SHALL be masked in logs

#### Scenario: Error tracing
- **GIVEN** an error occurs during microservice communication
- **WHEN** the error is handled
- **THEN** it SHALL log the complete error stack trace
- **AND** it SHALL include request context (user_id, operation, parameters)
- **AND** it SHALL assign a unique trace ID for error correlation

### Requirement: Health Check Integration
The system SHALL integrate with microservice health checks to ensure availability before processing requests.

#### Scenario: Pre-request health check
- **GIVEN** a request is about to be made to the microservice
- **WHEN** the last health check was more than 60 seconds ago
- **THEN** it SHALL perform a quick health check to /api/v1/health
- **AND** if health check fails, it SHALL return 503 Service Unavailable
- **AND** it SHALL cache the health status for 60 seconds

#### Scenario: Health check failure handling
- **GIVEN** the microservice health check fails
- **WHEN** subsequent requests are made
- **THEN** it SHALL continue to use cached failed status for 60 seconds
- **AND** it SHALL not attempt individual requests until health is restored
- **AND** it SHALL log the health check failure for monitoring

### Requirement: Performance Metrics Collection
The system SHALL collect and report performance metrics for monitoring and optimization.

#### Scenario: Response time tracking
- **GIVEN** any API request is completed
- **WHEN** the response is received
- **THEN** it SHALL record the total response time
- **AND** it SHALL categorize metrics by endpoint and HTTP method
- **AND** it SHALL track percentiles (p50, p95, p99)

#### Scenario: Error rate tracking
- **GIVEN** requests are processed over time
- **WHEN** errors occur
- **THEN** it SHALL track error rates by endpoint and error type
- **AND** it SHALL maintain a rolling 5-minute error rate window
- **AND** it SHALL trigger alerts if error rate exceeds 5%
